=head1 VERSION

    Created: 19 Feb 2009 extracted from S29-functions.pod; added stuff from S16-IO later

    Last Modified: 06 July 2012
    Version: 15

The document is a draft.

If you read the HTML version, it is generated from the Pod in the specs
repository under
L<https://github.com/perl6/specs/blob/master/S32-setting-library/IO.pod>
so edit it there in the git repository if you would like to make changes.

=head1 Overview

The most common IO operations are C<print> and C<say> for writing and
C<lines> and C<get> for reading. All four are available as subroutines
(defaulting to the C<$*OUT> and C<$*ARGFILES> file handles) and as
methods on file handles.

File handles are of type C<IO::Handle>, and can be created with C<&open>.
Paths are generally passed as strings or C<IO::Path> objects.

C<&dir> returns C<IO::File> and C<IO::Dir> objects, which are
subclasses of C<IO::Path>.

    write                     binary writing (Buf)

File tests are performed through C<IO::Path> objects.

=head1 Functions

=over 4

=item open
X<open>

    multi open (Str $name,
        Bool :$rw = False,
        Bool :$bin = False,
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
        Any  :$nl = "\n",
        Bool :$chomp = True,
        ...
        --> IO
    ) is export returns IO::Handle

A convenience function that hides most of the OO complexity.
It will only open normal files.  Text is the default.  Note that
the "Unicode" encoding implies figuring out which actual UTF is
in use, either from a BOM or other heuristics.  If heuristics are
inconclusive, UTF-8 will be assumed.  (No 8-bit encoding will ever
be picked implicitly.)  A file opened with C<:bin> may still be
processed line-by-line, but IO will be in terms of C<Buf> rather
than C<Str> types.

TODO: document read/write/append modes (:r, :w, :a)

=item dir
X<dir>

    multi dir($directory = '.', Mu :$test = none('.', '..')) { ... }

Returns a lazy list of file names in the C<$directory>. By default the current
and the parent directory are excluded, which can be controlled with the
C<$test> named parameter. Only items that smart-match against this test are
returned.

The return value is a list of C<IO::File> and C<IO::Dir> objects.

=item note

    multi multi note (*@LIST --> Bool)

Does a "say" to C<$*ERR>, more or less.  Like C<warn>, it adds a
newline only if the message does not already end in newline.  Unlike
C<warn>, it is not trappable as a resumable exception because it
outputs directly to C<$*ERR>.  You can suppress notes in a lexical
scope by declaring:

    only note(*@) {}

=item slurp

    multi slurp (IO $fh = $*ARGFILES,
        Bool :$bin = False,
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
        --> Str|Buf
    )
    multi slurp (Str $filename,
        Bool :$bin = False,
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
        --> Str|Buf
    )

Slurps the entire file into a C<Str> (or C<Buf> if C<:bin>) regardless of context.
(See also C<lines>.)

The routine will C<fail> if the file does not exist, or is a directory.

=item spurt

    multi spurt (IO $fh,
        Str   $contents,
        Str  :$enc = $?ENC,
        Bool :append = False,
    )
    multi spurt (IO $fh,
        Buf   $contents,
        Bool :append = False,
    )
    multi spurt (Str $filename,
        Str   $contents,
        Str  :$enc = $?ENC,
        Bool :append = False,
    )
    multi spurt (Str $filename,
        Buf   $contents,
        Bool :append = False,
    )

Opens the file for writing, dumps the contents, and closes the file.

This routine will C<fail> if the file exists, unless the C<:append> flag is
set, in which case it will instead add the given contents at the end of the
file.

The routine will also C<fail> with the corresponding exception if there was any
other error in opening, writing, or closing.

=back

=head1 IO Types

=head2 IO

    role IO { };

The base role only tags that this is an C<IO> object for more generic
purposes. It doesn't specify any methods or attributes.


=head2 IO::Handle

    class IO::Handle does IO { ... }

A handle of a file, pipe or anything else that supports reading or
writing like a file.

=over 4

=item getc
X<getc>

    method getc (IO::Handle:D: Int $chars = 1 --> Str)

See below for details.

=item print
X<print>

    method print (IO::Handle:D: *@LIST --> Bool)
    multi print (*@LIST --> Bool)

Stringifies each element, concatenates those strings, and sends the
result to the output.
Returns C<Bool::True> if successful, C<Failure> otherwise.

The compiler will warn you if use a bare C<print> without arguments.
(However, it's fine if you have an explicit argument list that evaluates to
the empty list at runtime.)

    print;             # warns
    if $_ { print }    # warns
    if $_ { print() }  # ok, but does nothing
    if $_ { print () } # ok, but does nothing

=item say
X<say>

    method say (IO::Handle:D: *@LIST --> Bool)
    multi say (*@LIST --> Bool)

This is identical to print() except that it stringifies its arguments by calling
C<.gist> on them and auto-appends the C<output-line-separator> after the final
argument.

    Was:    print "Hello, world!\n";
    Now:    say   "Hello, world!";

As with C<print>, the compiler will warn you if you use a bare C<say> without
arguments.

=item printf
X<printf>

    method printf (Str $fmt, *@LIST --> Bool)
    multi printf (IO::Handle:D: Str $fmt, *@LIST --> Bool)

Output through C<Str.sprintf>. See L<S32::Str> for details.

=item  write

    method write(IO::Handle:D: Buf $buf --> Int)

Tries to write C<$buf>. The actual number of bytes
written is returned. It might return unthrown failures, to be
specified by each C<IO> implementation.

This is "raw" write. C<$buf> contains plain octets. If you want to C<write>
a C<Str>, you should C<.encode> it first, or use "print" or other
C<IO::Writeable::Encoded> methods.

=item slurp

    method slurp()

Reads all the remaining contents of the handle into a C<Str> (or a C<Buf>
if  the handle was opened with C<:bin>).

=item t

    method t() returns Bool:D

Returns C<True> if the handle is opened to a tty.

=item p

    method p() returns Bool:D

Returns C<True> if the handle is opened to a pipe.

=item eof

    method eof() returns Bool:D

Returns C<True> if the handle is exhausted.

=item seek

method seek(Int $position, Int $whence --> Bool)

Position this stream into C<$position>. The meaning of this position is
always in "octets".

Fails if the handle is not seekable.

TODO: make $whence an Enum

=item tell

    method tell() returns Int:D:

Returns the current raw position in the stream in number of "octets".

=item ins

    method ins( --> Int)

Returns the number of lines that have been read with C<get>.

=item input-line-separator

    method input-line-separator( --> Str) is rw

This regulates how "get" and "lines" behave.

The input line (record) separator, newline by default.
This influences Perl's idea of what a ``line'' is.
Works like awk's RS variable, including treating empty lines
as a terminator if set to the null string.
(An empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs.)
You may set it to a multi-character string to match a multi-character
terminator, or to Nil to read through the end of file.
Setting it to "\n\n" means something slightly different
than setting to "", if the file contains consecutive empty lines.
Setting to "" will treat two or more consecutive empty lines
as a single empty line. Setting to "\n\n" will blindly assume
that the next input character belongs to the next paragraph,
even if it's a newline.

You may also set it to a regular expression.  The value of C<$/>
will be (temporarily) set to the matched separator upon input,
if you care about the contents of the separator.

=item close

Closes the handle. Fails on error.

=back

=head1 IO::FileTests

    role IO::FileTests does IO { ... }

Provides ways to inspect a file or path without opening it.

If you apply that role to a class, that class must provide a C<path>
method which C<IO::FileTests>' method will call to obtain the path to
test. This C<path> method must return a C<Str:D>.

The methods are typically only one letter long (for now; perl 5 tradition
strikes) and are summarized in the following table:

    M  Test performed
    =  ==============
    r  $.path is readable by effective uid/gid.
    w  $.path is writable by effective uid/gid.
        x  $.path is executable by effective uid/gid.
    o  $.path is owned by effective uid.

    R  $.path is readable by real uid/gid.
    W  $.path is writable by real uid/gid.
    X  $.path is executable by real uid/gid.
    O  $.path is owned by real uid.

    e  $.path exists.
    s  $.path has a size > 0 bytes

    f  $.path is a plain file.
    d  $.path is a directory.
    l  $.path is a symbolic link.
    p  $.path is a named pipe (FIFO)
    S  $.path is a socket.
    b  $.path is a block special file.
    c  $.path is a character special file.

    u  $.path has setuid bit set.
    g  $.path has setgid bit set.
    k  $.path has sticky bit set.

TODO: methods created, accessed, modified

=head2 IO::Path

    class IO::Path is Cool does IO::FileTest { }

Holds a path of a file or directory. The path is generally divided
into three parts, the I<file system>, I<directory> and I<base name>.

On Windows, the file system is a drive letter like C<C:>. Relative paths
never have a file system part. On UNIX-based systems, the file system part
is empty.

The base name is name of the file or directory that the IO::Path object
represents, and the directory is the part of the path leading up to the base
name.

    path            file system   directory  base name
    /usr/bin/gvim                 /usr/bin   gvim   
    /usr/bin/                     /usr       bin
    C:\temp\f.txt  C:             temp       f.txt

=over 4

=item path

Returns the path (file system, directory and base name joined together) as
a string.

=item filesystem

Returns the file system part of the path

=item directory

Returns the directory part of the path

=item basename

Returns the base name part of the path

=item Str

Stringifies to the base name.

=back

=head2 IO::File

    class IO::File is IO::Path { ... }

Represents a path that is known to be a plain file (not a directory), at
least at the time when the object was created.

=head2 IO::Dir

    class IO::Dir is IO::Path { ... }

Represents a path that is known to be a directory, at
least at the time when the object was created.

=head1 Here Be Dragons

Everything below this point hasn't been reviewed properly

=head2 IO::Socket

    role IO::Socket
        does IO::Closeable
        does IO::Readable
        does IO::Writeable
        does IO::Streamable
    {
        has %.options;
        has Bool $.Listener;
        ...
    }

Accessing the C<%.options> would on Unix be done with I<getsockopt(2)>/I<setsockopt(2)>.

The $.Listener attribute indicates whether the socket will be a listening socket when
opened, rather than indicating whether it is currently listening.

=over

=item new

    method new(
        :$Listener, # initialises $.Listener
    )

The initial value of the $.Listener attribute is defined according to the following rules:

 * If $Listener is passed to .new(), then that value is used
 * If neither a local address nor a remote address are passed in, throw an exception
 * If no remote address is passed, then $.Listener is set to SOMAXCONN
 * If no local address is used, then $Listener is set to 0
 * If both local and remote addresses are used, throw an exception that asks people to
   specify $Listener

=item open

    method open()

If $.Listener is true, does a I<bind(2)> and a I<listen(2)>, otherwise does a
I<connect(2)>.

It's end-user use case is intended for the case where NoOpen is passed to .new().  .new()
itself will presumably also call it.

=item close

    method close()

Implements the close() function from IO::Closeable by doing a shutdown on the connection
(see below) with @how set to ('Readable', 'Writeable').

=item shutdown

    method shutdown(Str @how)

Does a I<shutdown(2)> on the connection.  See also IO::Readable.isReadable and
IO::Writeable.isWriteable.

$how can contain 1 or more of the strings 'Readable' and 'Writeable'.

=item accept

    method accept( --> IO::Socket)

=item method read(Int $bytes --> Buf)

Implements the IO::Readable interface by doing a I<recv(2)>.

=item method write(Buf $buf --> Int)

Implements the IO::Writeable interface by doing  a I<send(2)>.

=item getpeername

=back

=head2 IO::Handle

This role indicates that this object actually represents an open file
descriptor in the os level.

=over

=item method int fileno()

File descriptors are always native integers, conforming to C89.

=back

=head1 Classes

=head2 IO::File

This does file input and output.

    class IO::File does IO::Streamable {
        ...
    }

=over

=item new

    method new(
        Path :$Path,
        :$fd
        Bool :$NoOpen,
        :$Writeable,
        :$Readable
    );

The C<Path> and C<fd> options are mutually exclusive.  

C<NoOpen> is passed to C<IO::Streamable.new()>

Examples:

    # Read, no interpolation
    $fobj = IO::File.new(Path => qp{/path/to/file});

    # Write, interpolation
    $fobj = IO::File.new(
        Path => p:qq{$filename},
        Writeable => 1
    );

    # Read using file descriptor
    $fobj = IO::File.new(fd => $fd);

This final example associates an C<IO> object with an already-open file descriptor,
presumably passed in from the parent process.

=item open()

This function opens a file that had the C<NoOpen> option passed to the C<new> method.

=item IO.truncate

=item IO.fcntl

Available only as a handle method.

=back

=head2 IO::Directory

    role IO::Directory does IO::Streamable {
        ...
    }

=over

=item open

    $dir.open(
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
    );

Opens a directory for processing, if the C<new> method was passed the C<NoOpen> option.
Makes the directory looks like
a list of autochomped lines, so just use ordinary C<IO> operators after the open.

=back

=head2 IO::FileSystems

This represents the file systems mounted on the current machine (i.e. accessible via a 
filesystem path).  

    class IO::FileSystems {
        has Str $.illegal-chars; # i.e. /\x0
        has Int $.max-path;
        has Int $.max-path-element;
    ...
    }

=over 4

=item chdir FILENAME
X<chdir> X<cd>

=item chdir

Changes the current working directory to the one specified by FILENAME.
If it succeeds it returns true, otherwise it returns C<Failure> and
sets C<$!> (errno).  Note, though, that chdir affects only the system 
directory; most things in Perl 6 that need a current directory depend
on their thread's copy of $*CWD, so you probably want to set $*CWD
instead of using chdir().  


=item glob

Returns C<Path> objects.  Path.Encoding is set to $?ENC unless the 
Encoding parameter is passed in (see Path for further discussion of
encoding).  

=item rename

=back

=head2 Path

The "Path" role covers both the path to the file, and the file metadata.  They
are usually created with the qp{/path/to/file} syntax.  It could be a directory,
file, link, or something else OS-specific.  

    role Path does Str does Array {
        has Str $.Type;
        has Str @.Elements;
        has Str $.Encoding;
        has Buf $.Binary;
        has IO::ACL @.ACLs;
        has %.times;
    ...
    }

C<$.Type> can be C<File>, C<Directory>, C<Link>, or C<Other>.  See 
C<.create()> method documentation for how it is set.  

The C<@.Elements> array is a list of Str that contain the path elements, but
all are checked before being pushed onto the array.  Note that @.Elements
can not be accessed unless $.Encoding is defined.  

The C<%.times> has keys that can be e.g. C<ctime>, C<Modification>, and 
C<Access> (and maybe others on other operating systems), and the values are 
all C<Instant> objects.

When a Path is used as a Str, it allows some operations, so that it can 
be concatenated easily with other strings.  When used as an Array, it 
acts as an array of path elements.  

=head3 Methods

=over 4

=item new

While new Path objects will normally be created with the qp{/path/to/file} 
syntax, there are also OO-related alternatives.  

This is called automatically on object creation.

    multi method new(
        Stringy :$Path,
        Str :@PathElements,
        Str :$Encoding,

        Str :@Constraints, 
        Str :$Protocol,

        Str :$Target,
        Str :$LinkType,
        Str :$Type,
    );

Path and PathElements are mutually exclusive.  

If the $Encoding parameter is not defined, then, if Path is a Buf, 
the $.Encoding attribute remains undefined, otherwise it is set to 
$?ENC.  There are
a number of features that don't work without the encoding being set.  

$Constraints determines whether the $Path and $Target strings should be
assumed to be Unix-style, Windows-style, or something else.  

If the Type option is not passed in, the Path.Type attribute is initialised 
as follows:

    Value        Condition
    =====        =========
    Directory    $Path ends in a separator (i.e. /)
    Link         $Target is specified
    Other        $Protocol is specified
    Undefined    All other cases

If the $.Type attribute is read (which will happen in a number of cases,
including when you read $.Target and $.LinkType), but is still undefined, 
then an attempt is 
made to determine what its type should be from the filesystem.  If no 
answers are found using this method, then it defaults to "File".  

The C<Target> and C<LinkType> options are only relevant for links that have
not been created yet, or are to be overwritten; in all other cases, 
they will be determined from the filesystem.  If Target is not specified,
this Path is assumed not to be a link.  If LinkType is not specified, 
then the default is used (symbolic, on a Unix system).  

Examples:

    # These three do the same thing (on a Unix machine)
    $path = qp{/home/wayland};
    $path = Path.new(PathElements => ['home', 'wayland']);
    $path = Path.new(Constraints => ['Unix'], Path => qp{/home/wayland});
    $path = Path.new(Path => qp{/home/wayland});

    # This creates a symlink from /home/wayland/m to /home/wayland/Music
    $path = Path.new(
        Path => qp{/home/wayland/m},
        Target => qp{/home/wayland/Music},
    );

=item path

method path( --> Str);

Returns @.elements concatenated together for use as a string.  Usually this 
is the path that it was originally created with.  

=item canonpath

    method canonpath( --> Str);

No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a path.

=item realpath

    method realpath( --> Str);

Gets the real path to the object, resolving softlinks/shortcuts, etc

=item resolvepath

    method resolvepath(Str :@Types --> Str);

@Types can contain "real" and "canon", in any order, and the
method will run realpath and canonpath in the order specified.

=item ACCEPTS

    multi method ACCEPTS(Path $filename);

Test whether the specified filename is the same file as this file.  On a 
Unix system, this would presumably be done by comparing inode numbers or 
something.  

=item create
X<mkdir> X<md> X<directory, create> X<touch>

    method create(
        Bool :$Recursive,
        Bool :$Truncate,
    )

Creates/touches the specified path.  In the case of a link or a directory, no 
parameters are required.  If a file doesn't exist, then no parameters are 
required.  If the path already exists, then an exception is thrown, unless
the file is an ordinary file or a link, and $Truncate is true.  

The $Recursive option specifies that any necessary parent directories should
also be created.  

=item touch

Update timestamps on a file.  

=item delete

X<rmdir> X<rd> X<directory, remove>

    method delete(Bool :$Recursive --> Int);

This deletes the C<Path> from the filesystem.  If the node has children, it 
throws an error unless the C<Recursive> option is specified.  It returns the 
number of nodes deleted, and may throw an exception.  

=item get

    multi get () 

Returns the next line from $*ARGFILES.  (Note that other C<get> functions
and methods are operations on any iterator, not just an IO handle.)

=item lines

    method lines ($handle:
        Any  $limit = *,
        Bool :$bin = False,
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
        Any  :$nl = "\n",
        Bool :$chomp = True,
        --> List
    )

    multi lines (IO $fh = $*ARGFILES,
        Any  $limit = *,
        Bool :$bin = False,
        Str  :$enc = "Unicode",
        Any  :$nl = "\n",
        Bool :$chomp = True,
        --> List
    )

    # See also Str.lines and lines(Str)

Returns some or all the lines of a file or entries in a directory
as a C<List> regardless of context.
See also C<slurp>.  Note that lists are lazy by default, but you
can always ask for C<eager lines>.  Note that the limit semantics cannot be
duplicated by subscripting, since

    $fh.lines[^5]

reads all the lines before the subscript gives you the first five,
whereas

    $fh.lines(5)

reads only five lines from the handle.  Note that

    $fh.lines(1)

is equivalent to

    $fh.get

If fewer lines are available than the limit, it is not an error;
you just get the number of lines available.


=back

=head3 Other things

=over 4

=item * The mode of the file and the uids and gids of the user

=item * ACLs (access control lists)

=item * read-only filesystems

=back

There may be other reasons you can't actually read, write, or execute
the file.  Such reasons may be for example network filesystem access
controls and unrecognized executable formats.

Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems, the C<:r>,
C<:R>, C<:w>, and C<:W> tests always return 1, and C<:x> and C<:X> return 1
if any execute bit is set in the mode.  Scripts run by the superuser
may thus need to do a C<stat> to determine the actual mode of the file,
or temporarily set their effective uid to something else.

You can test multiple features using junctions:

  if $filename.IO ~~ :r & :w & :x  {...}

=back

=head2 IO::ACL

This is a basic abstraction; for better control, use the operating-system specific
interfaces, over which this is a thin veneer.

    class IO::ACL {
        has Str $.type; # "User", "Group", "Everyone", ???
        has Str $.id; # username or groupname; unused for $type eq "Everyone"
        has %.permissions;
                # Unsupported values may (or may not) throw
                # UnsupportedPermission when set or read
        has Path $.owningObject;
        ...
    }

The permissions used in C<%permissions> are:

=over

=item Readable

Should be supported by all filesystems as an item to read from the hash for the group
"Everyone".

=item Writeable

Should be supported by all filesystems as an item to read from the hash for the group
"Everyone".

=item Executable

Supported on most Unix systems, anyway.  Windows should be able to guess when this is
read, and throw an exception if written to.

=item Default

An ACL of User,fred,Default sets the user "fred" to be the owner of the file.  This can be
done with groups too.  Works on Unix, at least.

=back

The C<$.owningObject> attribute of C<ACL> shows what the ACL is set on.  On a
Windows system, this can be a parent directory, as permissions are inherited.

=head2 IO::Socket::INET

    class IO::Socket::INET does IO::Socket {
        has Str $.proto = 'TCP';
        has Str $.host;
        has Int $.port;
        has Str $.localhost;
        has Int $.localport;
        ...
    }

=over

=item new

    multi method new(:$host!, :$port, *%attributes) { ... }
    multi method new(:$localhost!, :$localport, :$listen! *%attributes) { ... }

Creates a new socket and opens it.

=back

=head2 IO::Pipe

    class IO::Pipe does IO::Streamable does IO::Readable does IO::Writable {
        ...
    }

Will need to set IO::Readable.isReadable and IO::Writable.isWriteable depending on opening
method.

=over

=item close()

If the file handle came from a piped open, C<close> will additionally
return C<Failure> (aliased to C<$!>) if one of the other system calls involved fails, or if the
program exits with non-zero status.  The exception object will contain any
pertinent information.  Closing a pipe
also waits for the process executing on the pipe to complete, in case you
want to look at the output of the pipe afterwards, and
implicitly puts the exit status value into the C<Failure> object if necessary.

=item IO::Pipe.to

    method to(Str $command, *%opts --> Bool)
    method to(Str *@command, *%opts --> Bool)

Opens a one-way pipe writing to C<$command>.  C<IO> redirection for
stderr is specified with C<:err(IO)> or C<< :err<Str> >>.  Other C<IO> redirection
is done with feed operators. XXX how to specify "2>&1"?

=item IO::Pipe.from

    method from(Str $command, *%opts --> Bool)
    method from(Str *@command, *%opts --> Bool)

Opens a one-way pipe reading from $command.  C<IO> redirection for
stderr is specified with C<:err(IO)> or C<< :err<Str> >>.  Other C<IO> redirection
is done with feed operators. XXX how to specify "2>&1"?

=item IO::Pipe.pair

    method pair(--> List of IO::Pipe)

A wrapper for I<pipe(2)>, returns a pair of C<IO> objects representing the
reader and writer ends of the pipe.

   ($r, $w) = IO::Pipe.pair;

=back

=head1 OS-specific classes

=head2 Unix

=head2 Path::Unix

=over

=item chown

    multi chown ($uid = -1, $gid = -1, *@files --> Int)

Changes the owner (and group) of a list of files.  The first
two elements of the list must be the numeric uid and gid, in
that order.  A value of -1 in either position is interpreted by
most systems to leave that value unchanged.  Returns the number
of files successfully changed.

    $count = chown $uid, $gid, 'foo', 'bar';
    chown $uid, $gid, @filenames;

On systems that support C<fchown>, you might pass file handles
among the files.  On systems that don't support C<fchown>, passing
file handles produces a fatal error at run time.

Here's an example that looks up nonnumeric uids in the passwd
file:

   $user = prompt "User: ";
   $pattern = prompt "Files: ";

   ($login,$pass,$uid,$gid) = getpwnam($user)
       or die "$user not in passwd file";

   @ary = glob($pattern);      # expand filenames
   chown $uid, $gid, @ary;

On most systems, you are not allowed to change the ownership of
the file unless you're the superuser, although you should be
able to change the group to any of your secondary groups.  On
insecure systems, these restrictions may be relaxed, but this
is not a portable assumption.  On POSIX systems, you can detect
this condition this way:

    use POSIX qw(sysconf _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED);
    $can-chown-giveaway = not sysconf(_PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED);

=item chmod LIST
X<chmod> X<permission> X<mode>

Changes the permissions of a list of files.  The first element of the
list must be the numerical mode, which should probably be an octal
number, and which definitely should I<not> be a string of octal digits:
C<0o644> is okay, C<0644> is not.  Returns the number of files
successfully changed.

    $count = chmod 0o755, 'foo', 'bar';
    chmod 0o755, @executables;
    $mode = '0644'; chmod $mode, 'foo';      # !!! sets mode to --w----r-T
    $mode = '0o644'; chmod $mode, 'foo';     # this is better
    $mode = 0o644;   chmod $mode, 'foo';     # this is best

=item stat

=item IO.stat

    $node.stat(Bool :$link); # :link does an lstat instead

Returns a stat buffer.  If the lstat succeeds, the stat buffer evaluates
to true, and additional file tests may be performed on the value.  If
the stat fails, all subsequent tests on the stat buffer also evaluate
to false.

=head2 IO::Socket::Unix

    role IO::Socket::Unix does IO::Socket {

=item pair

    method pair(Int $domain, Int $type, Int $protocol --> List of IO)

A wrapper for I<socketpair(2)>, returns a pair of C<IO> objects representing the
reader and writer ends of the socket.

   use IO::Socket;
   ($r, $w) = IO::Socket::Unix.pair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, PF_UNSPEC);

=item /(get|set)(host|net|proto|serv|sock).*/

Should be implemented by an external library.

=item lstat

Use C<stat> with the C<:link> option.

=item IO.name

Changed to C<.path>, but we haven't gotten around to specifying this on all of them.

The C<.name> method returns the name of the file/socket/uri the handle
was opened with, if known.  Returns Nil otherwise.  There is no
corresponding C<name()> function.

=item pipe

=item select(both)

Gone.  (Note: for sub-second sleep, just use sleep with a fractional argument.)

=head1 Additions

Please post errors and feedback to perl6-language.  If you are making
a general laundry list, please separate messages by topic.

=head1 Conjectural stuff

Old methods are moved here if it's not clear how they fit into the current
picture. If nobody comes up with a good solution, they are removed.

=head2 IO::Buffered

Indicates that this object performs buffering. The management of the
buffer is completely implementation specific.

=over

=item method flush( --> Bool)

Flushes the buffers associated with this object.

=item method autoflush( --> Bool) is rw

Forces this object to keep its buffers empty

If set to nonzero, forces a flush right away and after every write
or print on the currently selected output channel.
Default is 0 (regardless of whether the channel is really buffered
by the system or not;
C<$OUT_FH.autoflush> tells you only whether you've asked Perl
explicitly to flush after each write).
C<$*OUT> will typically be line buffered if output is to the
terminal and block buffered otherwise.
Setting this variable is useful primarily when you are
outputting to a pipe or socket,
such as when you are running a Perl program under rsh
and want to see the output as it's happening.
This has no effect on input buffering.


=back

=head2 IO::Streamable

This role represents objects that depend on some external resource,
which means that data might not be available at request.

    role IO::Streamable does IO {...}

=over

=item new()

    method new(
        Bool :$NoOpen,
        Bool :$Blocking,
        --> IO::Streamable
    ) {...}

Unless the NoOpen option is passed, an open will be done on the C<IO> object when it is
created.

If blocking is passed in, .blocking() is called (see below).

=item method blocking( --> Bool) is rw

This allows the user to control whether this object should do a
blocking wait or immediately return in the case of not having data
available.

=item uri

    method uri(Str $uri --> IO::Streamable) {...}

This should be callable on the class, and act like a kind of "new()" function.  When given
a URI, it returns an C<IO::Streamable> of the appropriate type, and throws an error when an
inappropriate type is passed in.  For example, calling C<IO::File.uri('http://....')> will
throw an error (but will suggest using just uri('http://...') instead).

=back

=head2 IO::Encoded

This is a generic role for encoded data streams.

=over

=item method encoding( --> Str) is rw

=item method locale( --> Str) is rw

Encoding and locale are required for sane conversions.

=back

=head2 IO::Readable::Encoded

This role provides encoded access to a readable data stream, implies
C<IO::Encoded>. Might imply C<IO::Buffered>, but that's not a requirement.

=over

=over 4

=item uri
X<uri>X<ftp>X<http>

    method uri(Str $uri --> IO::Streamable);
    sub uri(Str $uri --> IO::Streamable);

Returns an appropriate C<IO::Streamable> descendant, with the type depending on the uri
passed in.  Here are some example mappings:

    URI type IO type
    ======== =======
    file:    IO::File or IO::Directory
    ftp:     IO::Socket::INET (data channel)
    http:    IO::Socket::INET

These can naturally be overridden or added to by other modules.

=item %*PROTOCOLS dynamic variable

For each protocol, stores a type name that should be instantiated by calling the C<uri>
constructor on that type, and passing in the appropriate uri.
