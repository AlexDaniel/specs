This file contains miscellaneous questions about design and
specification that implementors have come up with that are
awaiting answers from Larry (TimToady) and/or others.
Answers are recorded here as well, but are moved into a
lower section of the file to keep the as-yet unanswered 
questions on top.  It's like an absurdly simple ticket system.

(See https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/pm.txt for
a previous incarnation of this file.)

As yet unanswered questions:

Q1: (pmichaud) Does numifying or stringifying a type object
    produce an immediate 'warn' or a Failure?  What's the
    expected result from:

        my $x;
        my $y = +$x;
        say 'alive';
        say $y;

    Is the warning generated at the point of assignment to $y
    or at the point where $y is used?


Q2: (pmichaud) What's the expectation of how "useless use of '+'
    in sink context" messages will be generated?  Are they
    generated at compile-time based on a trait of the (proto) sub,
    or is it something that &infix:<+> would detect and carp
    about at runtime?
